## **Objectives**

1. **Evaluate Performance and Trends**: Assess Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including gross profit, revenue growth, delivery times, and seasonality within sales patterns to identify strengths as well as areas the company can look to improve on

2. **Products and Customers**: To assess top-selling products in order to identify what products are most crucial to revenue and identify strategies to retain high-value customers for loyalty, customer satisfaction, and the company's long-term image and recognition within the market. 
   
## **Analysis**

1. **Gross Profit**: The overall company acheived over $32 million (USD) gross profit over the five-year span of the data, indicating strong performance.

2. **Delivery Time**: An average delivery time of about four and a half days suggests moderate efficiency with product logistics. However, benchmarking this metric against competitors may uncover opportunities to reduce delivery times to below four days, improving customer satisfaction and gaining an edge over competitors.

3. **Monthly Analysis**: December through Feburary appear to be the best-selling period; however sales plummet the following two months and remain stagnent until the following December. This suggests that targeted marketing and advertising campaigns specifically during the second and third quarters of the year may help boost sales during these slow periods.

4. **Product Diversity**: While PC sales contribute significantly towards overall sales, complementary product types such as accessories and household appliances provide additional revenue streams. 

5. **Customer Retention**: Cultivating appreciation and loyalty among high-value customers, such as entrepenuers, start-up ventures, and tech-savvy individuals, provide excellent growth oppourtunity. Providing these individuals and groups with loyalty programs and personalized recomendations can encourage repeat customers and long-term brand recognition.
